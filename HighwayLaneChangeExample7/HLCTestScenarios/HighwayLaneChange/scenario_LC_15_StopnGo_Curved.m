function [scenario, egoCar, roadCenters] = scenario_LC_15_StopnGo_Curved
% scenario_LC_15_StopnGo_Curved creates a driving scenario that is
% compatible with HighwayLaneChangeTestBench.slx. This test
% scenario is on a Curved road segment and contains six vehicles in the
% scene. In this scenario, the lead vehicle slows down in front of ego
% vehicle while others travel in adjacent lanes. In open loop, there is an
% expected collision between ego vehicle and lead car.
